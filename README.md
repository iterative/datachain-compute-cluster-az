# Supporting Infrastructure for DataChain Compute Clusters on Azure

## Overview

### 1. **Resource Group**
- **`azurerm_resource_group.datachain`**: Central resource group to organize and manage all related compute and storage resources for the DataChain Compute Clusters.

### 2. **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**
- **Azure AD Applications**:
  - `datachain_oidc_compute`: Represents the identity used by DataChain Studio to provision and manage compute resources.
  - `datachain_oidc_storage`: Represents the identity used by DataChain Studio to access storage resources.
- **Service Principals**:
  - Created for both OIDC applications above, allowing authentication and role assignment.
- **Federated Identity Credentials**:
  - Define OIDC-based trust between DataChain Studio and Azure AD applications, using a specific issuer and subject claim.

### 3. **Role Definitions and Assignments**
- **Custom Role: Compute (`azurerm_role_definition.datachain_oidc_compute`)**:
  - Grants permissions to manage AKS clusters and assign managed identities within the resource group.
  - Assigned to the `datachain_oidc_compute` service principal on the resource group scope.

- **Custom Role: Storage (`azurerm_role_definition.datachain_oidc_storage`)**:
  - Grants permissions to read/write/delete storage accounts and containers.
  - Assigned to the `datachain_oidc_storage` service principal on each authorized storage account.

### 4. **Storage Accounts**
- **`azurerm_storage_account.datachain_oidc_storage`**:
  - Retrieves information from the storage accounts that DataChain jobs should have access to.

## Security Considerations

1. **Least Privilege Access**:
   - Custom role definitions limit actions to only those required for compute and storage operations.

2. **OIDC-based Federation**:
   - Federated identity credentials eliminate the need for long-lived secrets, enabling secure and auditable access from DataChain Studio.

3. **Scoped Role Assignments**:
   - Storage permissions are granted only to explicitly defined accounts.
   - Compute permissions are limited to a single resource group.

4. **AKS Resource Group Boundaries**:
   - Permissions for the compute role are restricted to a single Resource Group, under which the AKS Compute clusters are created.
   - AKS will automatically create additional resource groups prefixed with `MC_` to host internal infrastructure like virtual networks and managed node pools.

## Architecture Overview for DataChain Compute Clusters

![architecture](diagram.jpg)

DataChain Studio operates in two main components:

- **Control Plane** — typically hosted and managed by DataChain as a SaaS platform.
- **Compute & Data Plane** — deployed within your Azure subscription, including:
  - Kubernetes clusters (e.g., AKS) provisioned through OIDC-authenticated access.
  - Blob storage accounts accessed securely using fine-grained roles and federated identities.
